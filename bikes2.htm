<p align=justify>This research aims at recognising drop and pick events in cluttered environments, as well as connecting drops with picks of the same object. This helps in providing an automatic log of events occurring. It can also be utilized in security applications like theft detection. Due to visual ambiguities arising from occlusion and noise, we find the best constrained globally optimal explanation given all data up-to-date. The approach is being evaluated on a several-days datasets from CCTV cameras.</p>

<h2>Research Motivation</h2>
<p align=justify>Several local councils had been installing CCTV cameras on top of bicycles racks to deter bicycle thefts. In June 2007, York had announced such a scheme after they noticed an alarming increase in bicycle thefts (<a href="http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/yorknews/display.var.1455377.0.cctv_cameras_at_bike_racks.php">The press</a>). Yet installing CCTV cameras that are manually monitored has not proven as efficient as required in London for example. Daniel Westrop had been stealing two bicycles a day in the full view of CCTV cameras. (<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=457139&in_page_id=1770">Daily Mail</a>). A solution is thus saught to minimize the monitoring time and highlight cases where thefts are suspected.</p>

(a) When activity is detected inside the racks area, changed pixels grouped into clusters and trajectories are stochastically linked <br/>
(b) The match between pixels is used to connect drop to pick events<br/>
(c) A constrained globally optimal solution is seeked for all observations available up till now<br/>
