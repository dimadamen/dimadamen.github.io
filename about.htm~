<p align="justify">In Feb 2010, I started a research associate position working on the Cognito research project. The UoB team includes <a href="http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~andrew/">Dr. Andrew Calway</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~wmayol/">Dr. Walterio Mayol-Cuevas</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/home/gee/">Mr. Andrew Gee</a>.</p> 

<p align="justify">I finished my PhD in Computer vision under the supervision of <a href="http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/dch" target=_top>Prof. David Hogg</a> in 2009.
I submitted my thesis in September 2009 and was awarded the doctorate of philosophy on the 16th of Nov 2009.

<p align=justify>During the past three years, I have worked on three problems: detecting people dropping and picking bicycles from a bicycle rack, detecting carried objects from short video sequences and relating the person entering a building with/without carried objects to the departure of that person. Publications related to the three problems can be found in the <a href="publications.htm">publications section</a>
