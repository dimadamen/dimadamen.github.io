<p>
    Robust motion representations for action recognition have achieved
    remarkable performance in both controlled and in-the-wild scenarios.</p>
    
    <p>
Such representations are primarily assessed for their ability to label a sequence
according to some predefined action classes (e.g. walk, wave,
open). Although increasingly accurate, these classifiers are likely to label
a sequence, even if the action has not been fully completed, because
the motion observed is similar enough to the training set. Consider the
case where one attempts to drink but realises the beverage is too hot. A
        drinking-vs-all classifier is likely to recognise this action as drinking regardless.</p>
    
    <p>
We introduce the term action completion as a step beyond the
task of action recognition. It aims to recognise whether the action's goal
has been successfully achieved. The notion of completion differs per action
and could be infeasible to verify using a visual sensor, however, for
many actions, an observer would be able to make the distinction by noticing
subtle differences in motion.
    </p>
    
    <p>Since the notion of completion differs per action, a general action
completion method should investigate the performance of different types
of features to accommodate the various action classes. For example, for
the action pick, the difference between complete and incomplete actions
originates from the subtle change in body pose when holding an object,
or by observing an object in the hand. On the other hand, for the action
drink, the speed at which the action is performed is better able to assess
the completion. We propose a method that chooses the feature(s) suitable
for recognising completion from the pool of depth features using by
leave-one-person-out cross validation on the training set and automatically
selecting the most discriminative feature(s).
