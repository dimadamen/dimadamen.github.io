<p><b> PhD Studentship in Egocentric Vision</b></p>

<p>Applications are invited for a fully-funded PhD studentship (UK/EU Fees + Maintenance) in Computer Vision. The successful candidate will be working on a project focused on learning object interactions from ego-centric viewpoint (i.e. glass-mounted camera).</p>

<p>Ego-centric vision is an exciting area of research, with plenty of potential, recently brought to people's attention by the introduction of wearable-ware such as Google Glass, Recon Jet, GoPro and others. The successful applicant will be using Google Glass to develop a method that learns interactions with objects of daily living (ODL) in an unsupervised manner. By studying the way multiple people use objects in a shared environment, knowledge on how ODLs can be used would be attained.</p>


<b>Academic Requirements:</b><br/>

- A minimum 2.1 honours degree or equivalent in Computer Science, Electrical and Electronic Engineering or other relevant subjects. <br/>
- Solid mathematical ability and excellent programming skills. <br/>
- Basic knowledge of Computer Vision and/or machine learning would be very useful. <br/>

<p>Start Date: 1 October 2014 </p>

<p>Deadline: open till filled - applications are invited for as soon as possible. </p>

<p>For informal enquiries, contact Dr. Dima Damen: <a href="mailto:damen@cs.bris.ac.uk">damen@cs.bris.ac.uk</a> </p>

<p>Please ensure that:<br/>
<ul>
<li> You apply for a PhD in Computer Science
<li> You mention Dr. Dima Damen as a potential supervisor in your application
<li> In the Funding section you tick 'would like to be considered for a funding award from the Department' and specify the title of the scholarship 'PhD Research Studentship - Ego-centric Vision' in the other box below.
</ul>

<p>**Important**<br/>
Studentship covers full UK/EU (EU applicants who have been resident in the UK for 3 years prior to application) PhD tuition fees and a tax-free stipend at the current EPSRC rate (Â£13,726 in 2013/2014). EU nationals resident in the EU may also apply and will qualify only for PhD tuition fees.</p>
